## 📖 The Story of Invention
We often view **Artificial Intelligence** as a simple resource for information, but we frequently overlook its true power as a **partner for invention**.

This project was born from a desire to bridge the gap between digital fandom and personal sentiment. As fellow **League of Legends** players, I noticed the genuine thrill my partner felt during the game’s "Hextech Reroll" system—that high-stakes moment of gambling shards for a legendary outcome. 

I decided to recreate that psychological thrill in a real-world context for his birthday. 

### 🎮 The Gameplay Mechanics
Using iterative prompting and collaborative logic design with **Gemini**, I developed a three-stage experience:

1.  **Memory Lane Lane:** A 4x4 reconstructive matrix using our personal photos to "extract" key fragments.
2.  **The Block Forge:** A high-score challenge inspired by *Block Blast*, requiring strategic placement to forge the Masterwork Key.
3.  **The Loot Vault:** A fully functional Hextech Chest that allows the user to **Claim** a common reward or **Reroll** 3 shards into a "Permanent Ultimate" prize.

## 💡 Reflection
In a world where code is more accessible than ever, the real value lies in the **creativity of the invention**. AI didn't just write the code; it helped me build a bridge between an inside joke and a functional product.
