🛡️ The Heart-Tech Vault: A Study in AI-Driven Invention
The Vision
This project explores the intersection of personalized gift-giving and gamified web development. Inspired by the Hextech Crafting system in League of Legends, the application was built to replicate the psychological "thrill of the reroll" for a birthday experience.

The Story
The goal was to move beyond the standard use of LLMs (simple Q&A) and treat AI as a Full-Stack Partner. The project was born from observing a user’s specific delight in gaming mechanics and translating that into a multi-stage web journey:

Stage 1: Memory Lane Lane – A 4x4 matching engine utilizing personal JPEG assets to ground the digital experience in real-world sentiment.

Stage 2: The Block Forge – A React-based recreation of the "Block Blast" mobile game, requiring a 500-point threshold to "forge" the final key.

Stage 3: Hextech Loot Logic – A complex state-management system that allows users to "Claim" common rewards or "Reroll" them into an Ultimate Grand Prize.

Technical Stack
Framework: React + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Custom Hextech UI Palette)

AI Collaborator: Gemini 3 Flash (Vibe Coding methodology)

Deployment: Netlify

Project Reflection
"People tend to only know about AI resources for information, but often neglect the creativity of invention." This repository serves as proof that with the right prompting and a clear creative vision, the barrier between "Idea" and "App" has officially vanished.
